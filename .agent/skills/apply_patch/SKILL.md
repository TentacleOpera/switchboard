# Apply Patch Skill

This skill allows the agent to apply code changes generated by another agent (like Flash) without consuming tokens to read and manually type the edits.

## Usage

1.  **Generate Response**: Ensure the upstream agent (Flash) has output its response to a file (e.g., `response.md`).
2.  **Format Requirement**: The response file MUST have file paths preceding code blocks.
    ```markdown
    src/utils.js
    ```javascript
    const foo = 'bar';
    ```
    ```
3.  **Execute**:
    Run the script using `node`:
    ```bash
    node .agent/skills/apply_patch/apply-patch.js <path_to_response_file>
    ```

## Verification
After running the patch, you should checking `git status` or `git diff` to verify the applied changes.
