# Project Manager Integration

**Complexity:** 5

## Goal

Make the Project Manager a first-class citizen of the board: promote the PM from an optional agents-tab role to a core, default-visible role (so fresh setups get a live PM terminal and the Manage button dispatches instead of clipboard-falling-back), and add a global toolbar button that sends the selected plans to the PM terminal as a targeted autonomous oversight pass (board order; coding lane WIP 1 gated on code review; planner lane with a 2-minute cooldown; complexity-routed dispatch via /kanban/dispatch).

## How the Subtasks Achieve This

- **Promote Project Manager to a Core Role (Agents Tab)**: Moves the PM row from the Optional group into the Core group in the agents tab (`kanban.html:2898` → after Analyst at `:2881`), adds `checked`, and flips the `getVisibleAgents()` default (`TaskViewerProvider.ts:4528`) from `false` to `true`. Result: fresh installs register a live PM terminal by default, so the Manage button — and the new targeted-pass button — dispatch to a real terminal instead of falling back to the clipboard. Existing users who explicitly saved the PM off keep their saved value (verified `{...defaults, ...saved}` merge order in all three persistence tiers).
- **Board → Manager: "Run Selected Plans" Targeted Pass Button**: Adds a global toolbar button beside Create Worktree (`kanban.html:2628`) that freezes the current cross-column card selection into plan records at click time (excluding feature rows and epic subtasks host-side) and delivers a targeted-pass prompt to the PM terminal via the existing `_handleDispatchProjectManager` delivery plumbing (`TaskViewerProvider.ts:22178`). The prompt drives the manage skill's §6 oversight loop with the explicit plan list as the queue: coding lane WIP 1 gated on code-review completion, planner lane overlapping with a 2-minute cooldown, per-card `cardStage` tracking in `oversight-state.md`, halt-on-failure, end-of-pass digest.

## Dependencies & sequencing

- **Cross-feature dependencies:** none new — both subtasks build on machinery already shipped 2026-07-10 (`POST /kanban/dispatch` with complexity auto-routing, manage skill §6 Column Oversight, PM-terminal delivery plumbing).
- **Shipping order within this feature:** ship **Promote Project Manager to a Core Role** first. There is no code dependency between the two, but the targeted-pass button is only usable end-to-end when a live PM terminal exists — the promotion guarantees that on fresh setups, and it also makes the pass button's manual verification path work without extra setup. The promotion is a complexity-2 change and lands in minutes.
- **Prerequisites / guards:** the targeted pass inherits `_handleDispatchProjectManager`'s API-server liveness pre-flight and the §6 single-pass guard (`oversight-state.md` in-flight check → resume-or-refuse). No interaction with autoban timers or `/orchestration/start`.
- **Shared surfaces:** both plans touch `kanban.html` and `TaskViewerProvider.ts` but in disjoint regions (agents tab + visibility defaults vs. toolbar + PM dispatch plumbing) — no merge conflict or contradiction; they can be coded in the same session or separately.

## Completion Summary

Both subtasks implemented. **Promote PM to Core Role:** moved the Project Manager row from the Optional group into the Core group in `src/webview/kanban.html` (after Analyst, with `checked`), flipped the visibility default from `false` to `true` in both `src/services/TaskViewerProvider.ts` (`getVisibleAgents`) and `src/webview/sharedDefaults.js` (`DEFAULT_VISIBLE_AGENTS`). **Targeted Pass Button:** added a global toolbar button (`btn-manager-pass`) beside Create Worktree in `kanban.html` with the `{{ICON_MANAGER_PASS}}` icon (icons-125, wired in `KanbanProvider.ts` iconMap); added the `dispatchManagerForSelected` webview verb handler in `KanbanProvider.ts` (click-time plan-record resolution with feature-row + epic-subtask exclusion, 30-plan cap, unresolvable-id drop); extracted `_deliverPromptToPmTerminal` from `_handleDispatchProjectManager` in `TaskViewerProvider.ts` and added `_buildTargetedPassPrompt` + `handleDispatchManagerForSelected` (API-server pre-flight, two-lane prompt with `cardStage`/`plannerLane` fields); added §6a "Targeted Pass" subsection to `switchboard-manage/SKILL.md` (both `.agents` and `.claude` copies); regenerated `protocol-catalog.json` + `verbAllowlist.ts`. Files changed: `src/webview/kanban.html`, `src/services/TaskViewerProvider.ts`, `src/services/KanbanProvider.ts`, `src/webview/sharedDefaults.js`, `.agents/skills/switchboard-manage/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/switchboard-manage/SKILL.md`, `protocol-catalog.json`, `src/generated/verbAllowlist.ts`. No issues encountered — `catalog:check` and `parity:check` pass; `mirror:check` has a pre-existing drift on `switchboard-contracts`/`switchboard-mcp` SKILL.md (unrelated to this feature).

## Review Findings

Reviewed 2026-07-11 (in-place reviewer pass over both subtasks, advanced regression analysis). No CRITICALs. One MAJOR fixed on the targeted-pass subtask: partial exclusions (feature rows/epic subtasks/unresolvable ids) were console-only — added a visible warning toast in `src/services/KanbanProvider.ts`. One MINOR fixed on the promotion subtask: added the missing Project Manager row to `docs/switchboard_user_manual.md` §3. Regression trace clean: `_deliverPromptToPmTerminal` extraction is verbatim (Manage button behavior unchanged), no double-triggers or races (dispatch is read-only + send-locked), `updateManagerPassButton` paired at all selection-mutation sites, defaults parity holds across host and all webviews. `catalog:check` and `parity:check` green after fixes; deferred NITs: "Manage prompt" toast wording on targeted passes, dead sub-condition in the epic-subtask filter.
