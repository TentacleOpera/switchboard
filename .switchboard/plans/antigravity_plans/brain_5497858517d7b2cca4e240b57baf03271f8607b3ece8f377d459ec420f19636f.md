# Syncing Experimental Changes to Dev

I hear you loud and clear: **`dev` is for development**, and `main` is for releases. You want your work on the server's `dev` branch but NOT on `main`.

The "refused to sync" error is likely because GitHub has branch protection turned on for `dev` as well. 

## Proposed Changes

If you are removing the protection on GitHub, we can proceed with syncing. However, we have one small issue: **your local `main` branch also has an experimental commit on it.**

### 1. Clear the experimental commit from `main`
Since you don't want these changes on `main`, we should "undo" that one commit on your local `main` branch so it matches the server.
```powershell
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### 2. Push to `dev`
Once protection is removed on GitHub, you can push your work to the development branch.
```powershell
git checkout dev
git push origin dev
```

## Result
- Your experiments are safely on the **remote `dev` branch**.
- Your `main` branch is clean and matches the server (no accidental releases).
- The "Sync" error will disappear.
