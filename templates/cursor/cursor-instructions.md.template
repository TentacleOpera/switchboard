# Switchboard Configuration for Cursor (Composer)

This project uses the **Switchboard** protocol for cross-IDE agent collaboration.
Cursor's Composer agent can participate via the Switchboard MCP server.

## Setup

1. Ensure the Switchboard MCP server is running (started by the VS Code extension).
2. Connect Composer to the MCP server endpoint.
3. Use the workflow triggers below to coordinate with other agents.

## Available MCP Tools

- **send_message** — Send structured messages for workflow actions (`execute`, `delegate_task`).
- **check_inbox** — Read messages from inbox/outbox (`verbose=true` for full payloads).
- **get_team_roster** — Discover registered terminals/chat agents and their roles.
- **start_workflow** / **complete_workflow_phase** / **stop_workflow** — Workflow control.
- **get_workflow_state** — Inspect active workflow and phase status.
- **run_in_terminal** — Execute commands in a registered terminal.
- **set_agent_status** — Update terminal/chat availability status.
- **handoff_clipboard** — Copy prepared handoff artifacts to clipboard.
